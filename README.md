# Service-Disruption
A telecom company is interested in developing an advanced predictive model to predict service disruptions based on the log files generated by multiple devices.
I have to output a csv file that can be handed to the operations team so they can priorities dispatch of technicians based on fault_severity prediction and its probability.
